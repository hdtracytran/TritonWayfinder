# TritonWayfinder 
A [website](https://sydney-su.github.io/TritonWayfinder/) created by Sydney, Khuyen, Tracy, and Anna for WIC Project Teams.
This website aims to bring awareness to public transport for UCSD students!
Come learn about the trolley, bus, and grocery shuttle! 
We'll also show you how to use public transport to get to some of our Triton's favorite resturants, grocery stores, and malls!
